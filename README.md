Bitcoin is revolutionizing the landscape. The allure of this adventure lies in its educational voyage: no matter which path you venture down, one constant remains. Bitcoin represents the ultimate frontier and the Holy Grail that leads us toward uncovering life as it was always meant to be. Bitcoin breaks free from constraints; it resonates at the highest frequency. It's the melody of innovation. Bitcoin resides in the space between circumstances and reality, pulsating with all human emotions and actions. It is the truth that many seek.

The Bitcoin-based Organization Builder represents a pioneering framework designed to establish a novel breed of organizations, capitalizing on Bitcoin technology and harnessing Bitcoin as a decentralized financial system. In its inaugural phase of development, this framework is comprehensively equipped to cater to the fundamental prerequisites of business proprietors embarking on entrepreneurial ventures. Gradually, Starwee will forge the indispensable tools essential for the seamless integration of Bitcoin into everyday business systems and beyond. In the imminent future, we will unveil a roadmap, elucidating our path and elucidating the intricacies of the tools we are poised to create.

For now, let's delve into the specifics of the current segment of our development:

It works on the basis of DID, which creates an employee profile to which they are recorded:

- time log from the time tracker

- commits from gitHub made by the employee

An organization creates contract terms, for example:

1. To receive a salary (a transaction from the salary treasury that is programmed with an overgrown DLC), an employee must record 100 labor hours and make 30 commits

2. To get a bonus in the amount of X, 140 hours and 50 commits are required

3. DORSI ( Decentralized Open-source Rating System Incentives)


2.2 Contracts (dlc for a fix with a human oracle on the qa onboard)
2.3 DORSI
2.4 SEMI

3. DEVS dep (production devs contracts (employees ))

3.1 DID NOSTR based (nostr linkedin) / (DID CV BTC)

3.2 creation of the tokens (done by the core team as part of the development movement*)

3.3 production of the tasks = committees


The development movement is written as a manifesto and signed by the owners. It is being revised.


4. SALES department (customer contracts):
