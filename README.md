# BoB v0.1
## Bitcoin-based Organization Builder

BoB focuses on enhancing organizational finance via the Bitcoin blockchain, promoting security, transparency, and efficiency:

- **Transparency:** Utilizes the Bitcoin mainnet for an open, verifiable transaction record, ensuring visibility for authorized stakeholders.
- **Security:** Emphasizes strong security with multi-signature authorization, time-locked contracts, and a Masterkey system for secure signature management, potentially accessible via a mobile app.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines financial processes through automated scripts, facilitating complex wallet systems for agile fund management.

BoB leverages Bitcoin's strengths to optimize financial operations, providing a secure and transparent platform for organizational finance.

- **Wallet Management:** Offers hierarchical wallet management, enabling address generation, balance monitoring, and transaction history tracking, ensuring HD standards compatibility.

- **Transaction Scripting:** Automates Bitcoin transactions with scripting to simplify complex transactions like batch processing and automatic fund redistribution based on predefined rules.

- **Multi-Signature Processes:** Incorporates multi-signature authorization to enhance security, requiring multiple approvals for transactions, and supports various organizational governance models with flexible multi-signature setups.
