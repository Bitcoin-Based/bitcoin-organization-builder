- **Transparency:** Utilizes the Bitcoin mainnet for an open, verifiable transaction record, ensuring visibility for authorized stakeholders.
- **Security:** Emphasizes strong security with multi-signature authorization, time-locked contracts, and a Masterkey system for secure signature management, potentially accessible via a mobile app.

BoB leverages Bitcoin's strengths to optimize financial operations, providing a secure and transparent platform for organizational finance.
